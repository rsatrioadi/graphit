Half the_world hates
What half the_world does every_day
Half the_world waits
While half gets on with it anyway
Half the_world lives
Half the_world makes
Half the_world gives
While the_other half takes
Half the_world is
Half the_world was
Half the_world thinks
While the_other half does
Half the_world talks
With half a mind on what they_say
Half the_world walks
With half a mind to run_away
Half the_world lies
Half the_world learns
Half the_world flies
As half the_world turns
Half the_world cries
Half the_world laughs
Half the_world tries
To be the_other half
Half of us divided 
Like a torn-up_photograph
Half of us are
Trying To reach the_other half
Half the_world cares
While half the_world is wasting the_day
Half the_world shares
While half the_world is stealing_away
